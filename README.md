# water_potability
This project involves conducting a comprehensive exploration of water quality metrics from 3276 water bodies. Employing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, we aim to understand the characteristics of water quality parameters and their implications.

Approach
The exploration comprises the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Tasks include handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.
2. Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
Univariate analysis focuses on exploring individual water quality metrics, such as pH, hardness, total dissolved solids (TDS), chloramines, sulfate levels, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, turbidity, and potability.
Bivariate analysis examines relationships between pairs of variables to uncover patterns and correlations.
3. Correlation Assessment
Correlation analysis helps identify associations between water quality metrics.
Assessing correlations provides insights into which variables may influence each other and how they relate to potability.
4. Visualization
Visualization plays a crucial role in understanding complex datasets.
Visual representations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices will be used to present findings effectively.
